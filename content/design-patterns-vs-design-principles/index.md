## INTRODUCTION

Design patterns and design principles are important terms in the area of software development.  Generally, although these terms are often used interchangeably, they are actually different things. Understanding two concepts helps to gain a better software design. In this context, the article highlights the difference between Design Patterns and Design Principles.

## DESIGN PATTERNS

Design patterns provide implementation details to solve specific design problems in code and are considered low-level solutions related to implementation. However, design patterns are not specific to a programming language. They are general solutions within Object-Oriented Programming. If the language supports the necessary features that come with OOP, the same design pattern can be applied to that language. 

Using design patterns helps to enhance the maintainability and scalability of code. Singleton, Adapter, Factory, and MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns are examples of these design patterns.

## DESIGN PRINCPLES

Design principles are the most essential concepts for ensuring that software is maintainable and flexible, providing high-level guidelines for designing with these features in mind. In other words, design principles can be considered as overarching guidelines at the top of the implementation process. SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Injection), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Aint' Gonna Need It) are some of the most well-known design principles.

## CONCLUSION

Both concepts are essential in software design. By using these concepts, code can be made more maintainable, flexible, and reusable. Design Patterns provide low-level solutions to specific problems, while Design Principles offer high-level guidelines. Understanding these concepts helps developers to choose appropriate approaches for each situation and create more efficient solutions.
